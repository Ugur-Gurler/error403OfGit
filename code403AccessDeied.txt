nstall Git using Homebrew:

$ brew install git
Install GCM using Homebrew:

$ brew tap microsoft/git
$ brew install --cask git-credential-manager-core
For MacOS, you don't need to run git config because GCM automatically configures Git for you.

The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you to log in using a browser window. You may first be asked to authorize an OAuth app. If your account or organization requires two-factor auth, you'll also need to complete the 2FA challenge.

Once you've authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored in the macOS keychain and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. Git will not require you to type your credentials in the command line again unless you change your credentials.
